You can Creating a dashboard with 30 tables in HTML is a complex task that involves a lot of code. Here's a simplified example to get you started. You can expand on this template as needed:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Dashboard with 30 Tables</title>
    <style>
        /* Add your CSS styling here */
        table {
            border-collapse: collapse;
            width: 30%;
            margin: 10px;
        }
        table, th, td {
            border: 1px solid black;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Dashboard with 30 Tables</h1>

    <div class="table-container">
        <table>
            <caption>Table 1</caption>
            <tr>
                <th>Header 1</th>
                <th>Header 2</th>
                <th>Header 3</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Data 1</td>
                <td>Data 2</td>
                <td>Data 3</td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Add more rows for your data -->
        </table>
        <!-- Repeat the above table structure for the remaining 29 tables -->
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This is a basic HTML template for a dashboard with one table. To create a dashboard with 30 tables, you'd need to duplicate the table structure (from `<table>` to `</table>`) for each table and populate each table with your data. You can also style the tables and the dashboard container using CSS, as shown in the `<style>` section.

Remember that this is a simplified example. For a more interactive and dynamic dashboard, you might want to consider using JavaScript and possibly a front-end framework like React or Vue.js. This example provides a starting point, but you'll need to adapt it to your specific requirements and style.
