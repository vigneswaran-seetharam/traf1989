To display an HTML table in a book-like view on a web page, you can use CSS styles to create a visually appealing layout. Here's an example of how you can style an HTML table to resemble a book:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    /* Style for the book container */
    .book-view {
      width: 400px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      background-color: #f7f7f7;
      padding: 20px;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
      box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
    }

    /* Style for the table */
    table {
      width: 100%;
      border-collapse: collapse;
    }

    th, td {
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
      padding: 8px;
    }

    th {
      background-color: #333;
      color: #fff;
    }

    tr:nth-child(even) {
      background-color: #f2f2f2;
    }

    tr:hover {
      background-color: #ddd;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="book-view">
    <h1>Your Book Title</h1>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Header 1</th>
        <th>Header 2</th>
        <th>Header 3</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
        <td>Data 3</td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows here -->
    </table>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This code creates a book-like container for your HTML table with appropriate styling. You can customize it further to fit your specific needs.
        <table>
            <caption>Table 1</caption>
            <tr>
                <th>Header 1</th>
                <th>Header 2</th>
                <th>Header 3</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Data 1</td>
                <td>Data 2</td>
                <td>Data 3</td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Add more rows for your data -->
        </table>
        <!-- Repeat the above table structure for the remaining 29 tables -->
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This is a basic HTML template for a dashboard with one table. To create a dashboard with 30 tables, you'd need to duplicate the table structure (from `<table>` to `</table>`) for each table and populate each table with your data. You can also style the tables and the dashboard container using CSS, as shown in the `<style>` section.

Remember that this is a simplified example. For a more interactive and dynamic dashboard, you might want to consider using JavaScript and possibly a front-end framework like React or Vue.js. This example provides a starting point, but you'll need to adapt it to your specific requirements and style.


To access AppDynamics data without an API key, you'll typically need to use another form of authentication, such as username and password. Keep in mind that using API keys or other secure authentication methods is recommended for production environments. Here's an example using basic authentication with a username and password:

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Replace these values with your AppDynamics controller information
controller_url = "https://your-controller-url"
account_name = "your-account-name"
username = "your-username"
password = "your-password"
application_name = "your-application-name"

# Construct the URL for fetching violations data
violations_url = f"{controller_url}/controller/rest/applications/{account_name}/applications/{application_name}/problems"

# Set up the headers with basic authentication
auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Make the request to get violations data
response = requests.get(violations_url, headers=headers, auth=auth)

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    violations_data = response.json()
    # Process the violations_data as needed
    print(violations_data)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

Replace the placeholder values (`your-controller-url`, `your-account-name`, `your-username`, `your-password`, and `your-application-name`) with your actual AppDynamics controller information and credentials.

Note: Using username and password directly in your code might not be the most secure method, especially in production. It's recommended to use API keys or tokens whenever possible. If you don't have API keys available, consider contacting your AppDynamics administrator or checking the documentation for alternative authentication methods.
